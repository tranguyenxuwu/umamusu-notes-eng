### ✨ Introduction

First and foremost—
**US Rank** is currently the highest tier in training, so it is not something you are guaranteed to reach every time you try 💦.
I myself had to challenge it multiple times to get the feel for it, and my scores improved gradually in this pattern:
**UA → UA3 → UA6** (Up to here was without _Kiremono_) **→ US** (With _Kiremono_).

A training **High roll** (lucky run) is essential, especially for individuals that do not have the **Kiremono** (Astute) trait 💡.

In this guide, I am using the **"No-Wisdom Deck"** strategy that I introduced in the Hot Spring Scenario article.
Currently, when aiming for a High Score with **Buena Vista**, this configuration is the most stable for reaching US Rank, so I hope you understand that choice 😊.

### 💡 Buena Vista US Rank Training | Deck & Digging Route Summary

#### 1. The Deck Formation ✨

Here is the actual Support Card Deck I used 👇
![image](https://assets.st-note.com/img/1763694773-TWOdVZb4ucpqRPxSz3HtLjYl.png?width=4000&height=4000&fit=bounds&format=jpg&quality=90)

- **Basic Concept:** Focused on highly versatile Support Cards.
- **Stamina Slot:** Adopted **Duramente** (Strategy: **Chaser**).
- **2nd Speed Slot:** Selected **Admire Groove** to boost the score for **Medium** distance.

This time, I was quite lucky because I got an individual with **Kiremono** 💦.
Buena Vista is relatively easy to get Kiremono on, so aiming for it from the start is a valid strategy ✨.
However, even though I had Kiremono, the training itself was a bit of a **Low roll**. This means that even **without Kiremono**...

_(As seen in the example of a non-Kiremono Chrono Genesis that High rolled)_
...reaching high ranks is possible. If you can bring your stats close to the **Speed** and **Stamina** **Cap**, there is a possibility to push the appraisal score even higher 💡.

#### 2. Actual Digging Order 💡

The actual digging sequence is as follows 😊:

**🔸 Junior Year**

> **Kennin (Perseverance) → Meiseki (Clarity) → Shikku (Dash)** > _(Note: Save the remainder of Shikku for the end of the Senior year)_

- **Outing:** Once during the Junior period 🏃‍♀️.

**🔸 Classic Year**

> **Goukyaku (Strong Legs) → Tensho (Soaring) → Shunsen (Flash)** > _(Remember to dig Yukoma in between)_

- **Outing:** Aim for 1 time in the first half of Classic & 1 time in the second half 💡.
- **Strategy:** Because this is a **No-Wisdom Deck**, I postponed **Tensho** and prioritized getting **Goukyaku** first 💨.
- After digging Goukyaku, consciously step on Power and Guts. However, Power tends to **Overflow** easily, so it is OK if this stat is lagging behind (under-leveled) a little 👌.
- **Speed:** Since the goal is **1900+**, priority is lower here, but step on it moderately. The key is to adjust properly to grab those delicious moments when **3-4 Friendship** trainings gather ◎.

**🔸 Senior Year**

> **Yukoma → Remaining Shunsen → Legendary Hot Spring (Hitou) → Remaining Shikku**

- During the Yukoma digging in the first half of Senior year, if you run out of bath tickets (usually around the start of the year), it is stable to insert an **Outing** there ♨️.
- **Legendary Spring & Yukoma:** Priority is to dig these fastest for stability 💎.
- **Shunsen:** Ideally, finish digging this before the **Summer Camp**, but often this is impossible 💦.
- After that, while stepping on delicious training stacks, you need to be conscious of **balancing your Speed** ⚖️. Since there are only 2 Speed cards in the Deck, it glows (shines) less often. The goal is to finish Shunsen and Shikku, then challenge the URA period with the aim of buffing stats massively ✨.

**※ Notes on High roll vs Low roll patterns:**

- **Legendary Spring:** Ideally dig it up before the Japan Cup (High luck factor).
- **Shikku:** Ideally finish digging at the very end; this further strengthens Speed/Power during the URA period.
- **Stamina:** If the Stamina card does not glow (Friendship), there is a high possibility of a **Low roll** → **Reset/Reroll recommended** 💦.

**💬 Supplement**

- Buena has no **Stamina Bonus** (but has Speed/Power Bonus), so we leave **Shikku** (which buffs Speed/Pow) for later here.
- **Wisdom:** To advance the digging progress, use up turns on Wisdom in the early game when there is no Friendship.
- **Stamina:** Target is **1800**, so step on it aggressively from the early game.

### Summary & Key Points for Buena Vista US Training 💡

This concludes the **Buena Vista US Training Example** 🏆.
Because it is US Rank, the road is not easy, including the **Support Cards** used and the digging route 💦.
Although I reached it in one day thanks to a lucky **Kiremono** run, in actual training, **waiting for a High roll and increasing your number of attempts** is extremely important ⚡.

The route and Deck introduced here are just examples, but I would be happy if they serve as a reference for "Aiming for US" 😊.
Once you get used to the feel of training, you can make higher-freedom adjustments, such as how you build stats or timing your **Outings**, even with the same Deck 💡.

Please give it a try!
